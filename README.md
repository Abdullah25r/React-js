Suppose, you want to clone or fork any repository. here are the following steps you should run the react app.
(Disclaimer: I use React 18 as it is an old version so the command might be different, I will provide you the lts command that runs it on any version).
Open up the terminal by simply dragging up from the bottom of the vs-code(make sure that you open git-bash).
Firstly, make sure that the terminal pointing to the right folder.
write this command  npm i or npm install
Secondly, npm run dev (this command is work on the old react version but it still working in today react) or simply write npm start.
